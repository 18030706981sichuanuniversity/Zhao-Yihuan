# Stocks-shiftsML
A new ML method for predicting Stocks shifts of fluorescent molecules based only on structural descriptors and the LightGBM algorithm
Based on 15,987 sets Stokes shift data processed with molecular fingerprints, we utilized an ensemble learning approach LightGBM algorithm to construct ML models for the prediction of the Stokes shift. The squared correlation coefficient (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the independent test set were found to be 0.86, 12.27 nm and 19.16 nm for optimal model.
